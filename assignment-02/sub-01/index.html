                You just don’t understand economics, like supply and demand.
                Don’t worry kiddo, where there’s demand there will be a supply;
                we’ll all have our roads.

                If I came to your house with some heavy armed buddies,
                demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage
                of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services,
                that you didn’t ask for, would you consider that theft?

                Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples
                can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.
                A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated
                with the highest respect.
